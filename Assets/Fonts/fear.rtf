\f0\fs24 \cf0 i was going to publically state that fear is a broken compass and i thought hmm maybe this is not an original thing to say so i google it, and i find that consensus is that fear is a compass. and now im thinking wait, should fear dictate what i do? i think having a meeting is a better compass than letting anxiety remind me what "needs to get done", because that may be based on emotions and not facts. So, i think fear is a broken compass, i guess i shouldnt be ashamed of that thought or be afraid of being "tryhard". specially since i think i can explain what i mean if required. how did you stop fear from telling you what you can't do? what is the relationship between your fears and time , have you mastered that demon? is it a demon? is fear a compass to you? or a broken one? \
